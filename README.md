# Rightscale API Client for PHP

This library implements Rightscale's 1.5 API in PHP.  It is currently incomplete
but the aim is to mirror the functionality of the official Rightscale ruby library

- API Documentation: http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/RightScale_API_1.5
- API Reference Docs: http://reference.rightscale.com/api1.5/index.html

This is an unofficial library and is *not supported by Rightscale.*
